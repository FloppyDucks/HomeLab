# HomeLab
This is my personal home lab I use for testing, messing around and learning. Anyone reading this I give you permission to hack, attack, pen test, probe, scan my network WITH THE EXPLICIT CONDITION that you tell me what/ how you did it, another condition is not leaking/selling/trading/exposing any PII to any other 3rd party that is not myself. This includes but is not limited to (passwords, user account credentials, banking/financial information, medical records, etc.) If you have any questions for myself you can reach me at blackwaters.online@gmail.com

The public IP for my Network is: 50.103.128.207
