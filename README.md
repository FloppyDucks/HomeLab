# HomeLab
This is my personal home lab I use for testing, messing around and learning. Anyone reading this I give you permission to hack, attack, pen test, probe, scan my network WITH THE EXPLICIT CONDITION that you tell me what/ how you did it. Along with not leaking/selling/trading/exposing any PII to any 3rd party that is not myself
